STORY_0,"You are the chosen one."
STORY_1,"The mighty pharaoh has decided to build the biggest monuments the world has ever seen, and you will help him. You will become a huge part of history - using one of the best innovations in Egyptian technology, [color=#c09d52]a giant slingshot[/color]!"
STORY_2,"Pharaoh has generously agreed to outline the shape he's going after using his personal holographic device - you need to match it as closely as possible."
STORY_3,"If you don't, chances are the pharaoh will be angry... and trust me, you don't want him to be angry! Don't worry though, it could be worse. After all, you're not a part of the group which will carve details into the stone manually... yet."
BLOCK_0,"This block of stone is quite heavy, both mass and friction-wise. It doesn't slide too much and can be used to push other blocks a great deal."
BLOCK_1,"The sandstone is lighter and more slippery than stone. You need to be a bit more careful when using it. It can be used to push other blocks more gently."
BLOCK_2,"The destroyer! It will crush other blocks, given enough power on impact. Also, it will self-destruct after it has landed."
